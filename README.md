# CS-300
In this course the main problem I was solving was to design and implement data structures to manage course information for ABCU advising. Project One had focused on analyzing all of the different data structures. In the second project I then implement a data structure, a hash table, to store and sort course information. This allowed for users to retrieve and display courses and their prerequisites in an organized alphanumeric manner.
Understanding that data structures play a crucial role in optimizing performance and approaching the problem initially. I evaluated the efficiency of different options like arrays, linked lists, and hash tables in previous assignments. Given the need for quick lookups and organized data I decided on a hash table for its average-case O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and searches. 
In Project Two one roadblock I encountered was related to input validation in the user interface. The program initially struggled with handling invalid inputs which caused it to enter an infinite loop if a user entered non-numeric values when prompted for a menu option. To overcome this I had implemented input validation checks to ensure that only valid integers were accepted. This involved using cin.fail() to detect invalid inputs, clearing the input stream with cin.clear(), and discarding the rest of the input buffer with cin.ignore(). These changes made the program more user-friendly by preventing it from crashing or becoming unresponsive due to invalid inputs. Additionally, this experience reinforced the importance of considering edge cases and user interactions in software design as I had not taken into consideration input validation methods very thoroughly in my preparation for this project. All of my focus was on analyzing the system design and data structures, so I overlooked this aspect that was actually very important to the overall usability of the program.
Working on this project has made me realize the importance of selecting the right data structure for any given problem. It also taught me how these decisions impact real-world constraints like time and memory. My understanding of how data structure choices impact the efficiency of software has expanded greatly, and I learned how to approach software design with a mindset that prioritizes both performance and maintainability. I also learned to deal with potential pitfalls, such as improper input handling, and to design solutions that are effective against such issues.
This project has significantly influenced the way I write code, emphasizing the need for clear documentation, modular design, and consistent naming conventions. Iâ€™ve learned to structure my code in a way that not only meets the immediate requirements but is also easy to extend and adapt for any future purposes. Incorporating industry best practices, such as input validation and error handling, to ensure the program is resilient and user-friendly is also key and something I will carry with me in all my future programs.
